Challenge Description: 
I am a poker champ with a poker face. I'm going on a journey to decipher this mysterious message sent to me by a fan. Come along and help me out!
This journey is going to be very loooong and very tiresome. If you're bored, maybe you can buy a hint to find out more about me. We could share fun facts about ourselves!

Challenge Hint:
Thanks for speaking to me. It was starting to get a little awkward over here. Here are some fun facts about myself:
* My dad used to call me Ace. He always told me it's because Ace is synonymous with being best, and we always saved the best for last. I love being called Ace.
* I am known as the Calculating genius because I have an unparalleled ability to calculate odds and read opponents
* Duck are my favorite animals
* I have a huge Hat collection
* My favorite Sauce is mentaiko
* I love eating salads
