Introduction

Poker Face is one of the challs in 2024 WhiteHack CTF competition.
It is one of the more interesting / fun CTF question i had done :).

Challenge Description: 
I am a poker champ with a poker face. I'm going on a journey to decipher this mysterious message sent to me by a fan. Come along and help me out!
This journey is going to be very loooong and very tiresome. If you're bored, maybe you can buy a hint to find out more about me. We could share fun facts about ourselves!

Challenge Hint:
Thanks for speaking to me. It was starting to get a little awkward over here. Here are some fun facts about myself:
* My dad used to call me Ace. He always told me it's because Ace is synonymous with being best, and we always saved the best for last. I love being called Ace.
* I am known as the Calculating genius because I have an unparalleled ability to calculate odds and read opponents
* Duck are my favorite animals
* I have a huge Hat collection
* My favorite Sauce is mentaiko
* I love eating salads

Challenge Update / Issue:
Regarding the Cryptography's Poker Face Challenge, there was an issue with the flag format. 

[PLEASE ATTEMPT THIS QNS BEFORE LOOKING AT THE SOLUTION]



CHALLENGE SOLUTION

This solution was a joint effort made by my friend and I after the competition has ended. 
We were unable to figure out the way to solve it during the competition, and only managed to finally obtain the flag afterwards.
We were unable to come up with a concrete way to do this question and spent quite a fair bit of time trying to decipher it.

Steps Taken
1. Thought process
With the question titled "Poker Face", we could confirm some of the details.
- 52 cards in a card deck (excluding jokers)
- 26 alphabets, meaning that each card will most likely represent either a UPPERCASE or lowercase alphabet

2. Challenge hints
After the challenge ended the first thing we did was to check out the challenge hint, and it was very informative.

- "we always saved the best for last" -> suggested that Ace is probably at the bottom of the deck (i.e. starts with 2,3,4...J,Q,K,A)
- The capitalisation of "C","D","H","S" within the next few lines suggested there was something important to it. Upon analysis, coincidentally they match with the suites of cards, "Clubs","Diamonds", "Hearts", "Spades"
- "I love eating salad". It seemed kinda odd to us at first, what can it relate to? We thought that it was a red herring.
- While doing we realised that since we were converting to numbers, salad might have been an indirect hint for "caesar cipher" because of "casesar salad".

3. Relooking at the question
Upon further analysis of the cards in the question, we realised that there were multiple instances of "KingDiamond" and assumed that it would most likely be a vowel.
The answer seems to be either a phrase or a sentence, with the underscores dictating its a new word
Hence by this logic, the first letter for "2Spade" would most likely correspond to either "A" or "I".

4. The tough part
Although we had gathered the information above, we still did not have enough information that could drive us to the answer.
Suite order: "Clubs","Diamonds", "Hearts", "Spades"
Order of number: 2,3,4...J,Q,K,A

How about character sets? We wrongly assumed that it was "ABC...XYZabc...xyz"
What this mean is, 
e.g1. We deem "2 of Clubs" to be the 1st card in the deck. The position in which the card is in the deck is referred to as the "INDEX".
INDEX 1, when referring to this character set, is the letter "A".
e.g2. We deem "Ace of Spades" to be the last / 52nd card in the deck.
INDEX 52, when referring to this character set, is the letter "z".

How about the way which the cards are ordered within the deck itself?
Is the card arranged in
1. 2Clubs, 2Diamonds, 2Hearts, 2Spades, 3Clubs, 3Diamonds ...... AClubs, ADiamonds, AHearts, ASpades
2. 2Clubs, 3Clubs, 4Clubs ... 2Diamonds, 3Diamonds, 4Diamonds ... 2Hearts, 3Hearts, 4Hearts... 2Spades, 3Spades, 4Spades...

We were unable to determine these so we had to just try out our approaches.
It was pretty obvious after a while that something was not right, despite trying the both ways to arrange the cards and caesar ciphering the results, we obtained nonsensical results.
We were at a loss of what to do and how to continue, honestly pretty fed up and wondering what was wrong.
Until.....

5. “Snow lands on top.”
We had already exhausted the possible combinations possible for how the cards can be arranged, we even thought that the hint provided was wrong and started changing the suites positionings.
The caesar ciphers largely returned us similar results despite changing the hierachy of the suites and the order of the numbers.
However, we suddenly had the idea that the problem might have been the character set instead.
With a newfound determination, we changed the character set to "AaBbCcDdEe...YyZz".
The original character set separated the UPPERCASE alphabets from the lowercase alphabets while this new character set alternates for each letter.

We decided to then test out the first few letters to ensure that the new character set, suite hierachy, and card arrangement is correct.
==========================================
Suite order: "Clubs","Diamonds", "Hearts", "Spades"
Order of number: 2,3,4...J,Q,K,A
Character Set: "AaBbCcDdEe...YyZz"
Card arrangement: 2Clubs, 3Clubs, 4Clubs ... 2Diamonds, 3Diamonds, 4Diamonds ... 2Hearts, 3Hearts, 4Hearts... 2Spades, 3Spades, 4Spades...

2SPADE _ 8SPADE 2CLUB 3DIAMOND 8HEART

2SPADE = 13*3 + 1 = 40 [13*3 as there are 13 cards in Clubs, Diamonds, and Hearts, and it is the 1st card in Spades due to order of number]
8SPADE = 13*3 + 7 = 46 [similar reasoning]
2CLUB = 1 [1st card in the deck]
3DIAMOND = 13*1 + 2 = 15 [13*1 as there are 13 cards in Clubs. Diamonds is the 2nd suite]
8HEART = 13*2 + 7 = 33 [13*2 as there are 13 cards in Clubs and Diamonds. Hearts is the 3rd suite]

Using the numbers obtained from the calculation above, we can use them as indexes for the character set.
40 _ 46 1 15 33 = t _ w A H Q

At first glance this does not make sense at all, but after coding a simple caesar cipher function and obtaining the possible results,
offsetting the above values by 29 will return us with ...

(40 + 29)mod 52 = 17
(46 + 29)mod 52 = 23
(1 + 29)mod 52 = 30
(15 + 29)mod 52 = 44
(33 + 29)mod 52 = 10

Remapping the numbers obtained after the offset and using them as indexes, we will obtain
17 _ 23 30 44 10 = I _ L o v e

Wow! This is actually a readable string! This seems to be the correct approach. By continuing the approach above, we would be able to end up with the final answer:
I_Love_Casesar_Salad

6. Conclusion

This chall is overall pretty fun, and not too code intensive. 
There have been instances when we felt it was kind of unsolvable and wanted to give up and move on to another question, but we perservered.
While some parts were pretty straightforward, the character set got us stuck for hours without any clues on how to proceed.
The card arrangement was also abit of a wild guess, and fortunately we managed to get it right with the new character set.

At the end, the challenge is akin to poker, blending skill with a dash of luck.
